            <p style="color: white;">The Ford straight-six is an icon in its own right, but the fourth-generation six introduced the Ford 300 engine,
                a 300 cubic inch/4.9-liter gasoline six-pot that was first offered in the 1965 F-Series pickup as a long-stroke
                version of the 240 six-cylinder. It produced 170 hp at the start, although a change in power rating standards
                meant that number dropped to 114 hp (net) in 1978 when the motor became the base option in the F-Series.
                Throughout its life, it saw its power increase, first to 122 hp in the 1980s and then to 150 hp in 1987
                when it switched to fuel injection.
                The Ford 300 was used for everything from pickup trucks to dump trucks that weighed as much as 20,000 lbs,
                with heavy-duty upgrades like forged internals making them absolute workhorses. It saw use in tractors,
                wood chippers, water pumps, ski lifts, and UPS trucks, and even won the Baja 1000 three times in a truc
                piloted by Scott Donohue.

            <img src="https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/9ll5yolg-a-sx14echm.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=750&h=422&dpr=2" widht="700" height="450">
            <p style="color: white;">We've all heard tales of diesel-powered Mercedes taxis cresting 600,000 miles in Germany without their
                engines ever being opened. Those are more than just fairytales, though, with much of that reliability
                attributed to the OM617 engine family. Testament to its longevity, the OM617 five-cylinder diesel
                engine was produced from 1974 to 1991 as a 3.0-liter with a cast iron block and head and a chain-driven
                single overhead camshaft.
                The OM617 is also considered a key factor in Mercedes's reputation for reliability in the US in the 1980s.
                It struck a perfect balance between power and reliability, two factors that diesel engines of the era weren't
                exactly well known for.
                It evolved from the OM616 four-cylinder, itself a reliable motor, and debuted in 1974 on the W115
                (an early predecessor to the E-Class) with just 79 hp and 127 lb-ft in naturally aspirated form.
                It was joined two years later by a turbo-diesel variant with 187 hp, which was dropped into the
                iconic Mercedes C111-IID concept, setting 16 world land speed records. A subsequent upgrade in 1978
                pushed output to 227 hp, adding another nine records to the C111's resume.

            <p style="color: white;">
                Toyota has a reputation for reliable motors, with the UZ family being one of the best. In the US,
                the GM LS may be the default V8 swap, but everywhere else in the world, the Toyota UZ is where
                it's at. This 90-degree V8 family started life in 1989 in the Lexus LS 400 - a legend in its
                own right - and remained in production until 2013. Its combination of power, reliability,
                and refinement saw it used in luxury sedans, minibusses, pickup trucks like the Tundra,
                and off-road SUVs like the Land Cruiser, Sequoia, and Lexus LX/GX.
                Displacements offered included 4.0 liters in the 1UZ, 4.7 liters in the 2UZ, and 4.3 liters
                in the 3UZ, but the latter generation also included 4.5- and 5.0-liter racing variants used
                in the Japanese Super GT and Grand American Road Racing (Grand Am) series. Known to be
                extremely under-stressed, outputs ranged from 256-500 hp.
                The UZ family was so reliable it was even used as the basis of a marine motor, while a twin-turbo
                derivative was used in aviation.

            <h1 style="color: white;">7-BMW M50</h1>

            <p style="color:white;">
                BMW and inline-sixes go together like baseball and hot dogs, but even among great BMW six-pots,
                the M50 stands out as a legend. Produced for only seven years from 1990-1996, it replaced the
                M20 when it launched in the E34 5 Series. Displacements ranged from 2.0- to 2.5 liters and
                power outputs from 148 to 189 horsepower. The M50 became the first BMW motor to use variable
                valve timing when it received a 1992 update that included a single VANOS on the intake cam.
                It also served as the foundation for the S50 used in the E36 M3, and its design was so
                mechanically sound that it inspired the next several generations of BMW six-cylinders.
                It wasn't just reliable in stock form, though, and its cast iron block is known for
                handling heavy doses of boost pressure in forced induction setups.

            <h1 style="color: white;">6-Toyota 1JZ/2JZ</h1>
            <img src="https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/screenshot-2024-11-28-13-43-34-2.png?q=49&fit=crop&w=750&h=422&dpr=2" widht="700" height="450">
            <p style="color:white;">
                Sports cars sound like the least likely place to find a reliable engine, given that they get
                driven hard, placing more wear on the motor. But the Mk IV Toyota Supra disproved that with
                its 2JZ engine and variants thereof. This legendary 3.0-liter inline-six had a cast iron
                block and an aluminum head and was known to be absolutely bulletproof. Tuners have squeezed
                out close to 1,000 horsepower on stock internals, reliably so, and for those left stock,
                standard maintenance is all it needs to keep on clocking hundreds of thousands of miles.
                The 1JZ also deserves mention - the 2.5-liter version of the JZ inline-six that spanned 17 years.

            <h1 style="color:white;">5-Volkswagen ABF</h1>
            <img src="https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/douglas-bowden-vw-golf-mk3-gti-20th-anniversary-135.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=750&h=422&dpr=2" widht="700" height="450" >
            <p style="color: white;">
                Another short-lived yet incredibly reliable motor was the Volkswagen ABF engine. This 2.0-liter
                16-valve four-cylinder was produced from 1992-1999 and was a performance motor found in the Mk
                III Golf GTI and fourth-gen Passat in several markets. It was known as a rev-happy motor delivering
                148 hp at 6,000 rpm and 133 lb-ft of torque at 4,800 rpm. It had a cast iron block and aluminum head
                with hydraulic lifters and fuel injection.
                While it is considered extremely reliable and is often used as a performance swap in early Volkswagen
                builds, parts are known to be pretty expensive, especially as they become scarcer. Common faults
                typically relate to ancillary sensors rather than the motor itself, with the throttle position
                sensor being a known problem.
               Still, the ABF is known to happily reach 250,000 miles with aggressive driving with no major issues.

            <p style="color: white;">
                People can say what they want about American build quality, but we know how to build a proper
                small block V8. The General Motors LS family of small-block V8s has been around since 1997,
                spanning three generations, with a fourth due in the next few years. Used in everything from
                the Chevy Silverado to the Camaro, the LS has proven incredibly reliable and easy to maintain
                in almost every form.
                Various displacements have been made available, from 4.8-liter versions (Vortec 4800 LR4) to
                7.4-liter ones. Between these outer limits, there have also been 5.3-, 5.7-, 6.0-, 6.2-, 6.6-,
                and 7.0-liter versions, with outputs ranging from 255-755 hp depending on the model.
                We're not going to pick just one as our favorite, though, as across the board, the LS has a 
                reputation for reliability, with truck owners recording hundreds of thousands of miles of 
                trouble-free motoring and tuners using the LS for easy, reliable power in just about every
                situation.

            <p style="color: white;">
                You had to know there'd be a reliable Honda engine on this list, and it's none other than the
                ever-popular K-series. Launched in 2001, these dual overhead camshaft-equipped (DOHC)
                four-cylinder motors range in displacement from 2.0 to 2.4 liters and have served in a
                variety of Honda models from the early Civic Type R to the Integra, Accord, CR-V, Acura RDX,
                and so much more.
                Available in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged forms, the latter have proven the most
                reliable and popular as an engine swap for car enthusiasts, with a high-rev ceiling and bulletproof
                engineering making them perfect for revvy performance builds where reliability is paramount.
                The K20 and K24 variants have proven most popular and have also been considered some of the
                better-sounding four-cylinder engines of their era, particularly early variants. And yes,
                the K-series has V-TEC, just like any good Honda engine should.

            <p style="color: white;">
                Yeah, it's another Toyota engine, but what can we say? Toyota knows how to make a reliable engine.
                The GR engine family - not related to GR models that use the Gazoo Racing branding - spans eight
                different variants and multiple sub-variants, but the 2GR is the most widely renowned for its
                reliability. This is the 3.5-liter, 60-degree V6 produced from 2005 till today that you know
                and love from the Toyota Tacoma, Camry, Highlander, and Avalon, as well as the Lexus ES, GS,
                IS, RX, and various others. It was even used in the Lotus Evora and as a racing engine in
                the Toyota Corolla.
                The 2GR-FSE variant has earned a spot on the Ward's 10 Best Engines list multiple times and is
                a favorite among fans who appreciate its reliability and robustness in any application.
                Constructed with a die-cast aluminum block and an aluminum head, it's one of the most modern
                engines on this list and also one of the most powerful, with outputs ranging from 237-316 hp
                depending on application.

            <p style="color: white;">
                We could've spent days of research and thousands more words to try and cover the most reliable
                engines out there but settled for the ten above. Still, some nearly made the cut that we feel
                deserve mention.
                Mitsubishi 4G63T - The same turbocharged four-cylinder that powered Mitsubishi to victory in
                the WRC served in the Eclipse, the Lancer EX, the Lancer Evo, and the Pajero.
                Nissan VQ35HR - Some despise it, but the updated 3.5-liter V6 from the Infiniti G35 and Nissan
                350Z can take its fair share of abuse before tapping out.
                Toyota UR - Available in 4.6-, 5.0-, and 5.7-liter configurations, the UR V8 replaced the UZ
                engine mentioned above and continued its reputation for reliability.
                Honda B-series - From 1.6-2.0 liters in displacement, the B-series preceded the K-series from
                1988 to 2001 and powered almost every mainstream Honda you could buy. They helped solidify
                Honda's hard-earned reputation for reliability.
                Mercedes-Benz OM606 - Merc's diesel inline-six is considered by many the 2JZ of the diesel world.
                Newer than the Merc five-cylinder we listed above, it lasted from 1993-2001 in series production
                and required minimal maintenance to last hundreds of thousands of miles.
                AMC/Jeep 4.0 Straight-Six - Developed in just 26 months and entering production in 1986, more than
                five million of these engines were built, held in high regard by everyone for their reliability.
                This iconic inline-six was once described as "as reliable as a block of wood" by Popular Mechanics,
                which claimed it could "suffer running conditions that'd kill most motors."
