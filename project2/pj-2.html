        <p>Toyota introduced the new Camry in 2006, revealing a completely revised design and, for the first time in this lineup,
            a hybrid version. The 8th generation Camry is available with a variety of inline-4 engines and one V6 version – all
            powertrain combinations are robust and smooth, so feel free to choose one according to your power requirements.

            However, be careful if you’re opting for the hybrid version because batteries in a 10-15-year-old car can be extremely worn.
            
            While all Camrys are generally reliable, it’s recommended to avoid 2007 and 2008 model years due to numerous flaws, such as
            a slow and overheating transmission, a faulty check engine light, and occasional power steering issues.
            
            Overall, the 8th-gen Camry is a comfortable and dependable midsize car that’s packed with modern features and is
            available with both automatic and manual transmissions. J.D. Power gave the 2009 model an 85/100 reliability score,
            proving that owners don’t face issues often.</p>
