            The Toyota Prius is one of the most reliable hybrid cars and is driven by anyone from teachers to taxi drivers.
            Car enthusiasts often hate the Prius for its bland design and poor performance… Or perhaps it’s because their 
            modified cars consume twice as much fuel and suffer from various problems.
            The Prius series is known for its efficient hybrid system. The second generation model uses a power-split
            (series-parallel) hybrid drivetrain, making about 46 mpg combined. Its shallow cycling charging system ensures
            the battery is always at a healthy 40-80% charge, therefore, Prius batteries tend to last longer than other hybrid
            vehicles (often more than 200,000 miles).
            Don’t expect an exciting ride or performance, though. The Prius was developed as “the car of the 21st century”,
            focusing on reducing the carbon footprint, fuel consumption, and providing everything a family needs without being excessive.
