        <p>The current 12th-generation Corolla is also available as a hybrid. Only 5% of owners experienced any issues with this car,
            all of which were related to the 12-volt battery system. The Corollaâ€™s engines are bulletproof, the electronics don't have
            any niggles, and Toyota's hybrid system works flawlessly.
            Toyota Corolla is the best-selling car globally not only because of its reliability. It starts from $20,000 and packs LED
            lighting, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, a rearview camera, a 7-inch infotainment screen, the Pre-Collision
            system, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assistance, and a bunch of other comfort and safety features as standard. The hybrid
            version is available with 1.8-liter or 2.0-liter petrol engines, averaging 52 mpg.</p>
