        Giorgi Mamardashvili (Order of Honor) (Georgian: გიორგი მამარდაშვილი; born 29 September 2000) is a Georgian professional
        footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for La Liga club Valencia and the Georgia national team. He will join Premier League
        club Liverpool on 1 July 2025.
        Mamardashvili spent much of his youth years at Dinamo Tbilisi. After signing a professional contract with this club, he
        was loaned to other Erovnuli Liga teams for three seasons before his transfer to Valencia. He has quickly established
        himself as a first-choice shot-stopper, becoming the first ever Georgian goalkeeper in the Spanish top tier.
        In 2020 and 2024 respectively, Mamardashvili was named as Goalkeeper of the Year and Footballer of the Year in Georgia.
